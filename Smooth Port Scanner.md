## Description

This is a simple Python script for performing port scanning on an IPv4 address using the `python-nmap` library. The script allows the user to input an IP address and a range of ports to scan. It then scans each port in the specified range and displays its status (open, closed, or filtered). The script is intended for educational and learning purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically.

### How to Use

1. Install Required Packages: Before running the script, make sure you have Python 3 and the required packages installed. If you are using Kali Linux, you can install the necessary packages by running the following commands:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 python3-pip pip3 install python-nmap`
    
2. Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-port-scanner.git`
    
3. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project folder:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd simple-port-scanner`
    
4. Run the Script: Execute the Python script using the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `python3 port_scanner.py`
    
5. Follow the Instructions: The script will prompt you to enter the IPv4 address you want to scan and the range of ports you want to scan. Enter the required information as per the instructions.
    
6. View Results: The script will perform the port scanning and display the status of each scanned port. Additionally, it will print the list of open ports found during the scan.
    

### Note

Please ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any system or network. Unauthorized port scanning can be considered illegal and unethical. Use this tool responsibly and only on systems and networks you have permission to scan.
